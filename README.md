Check_Matrix function:

1. First run the main file in order to compute the self coded P and G matrices for the example matrices. In order to get the example world within 'main'set generateRandomWorld = false. Given the example_G and example_P data files within the same folder path, subsequently running Check_Matrix will determine if the two correspond. Retuned 0 means they do not, returned 1 means they do.
